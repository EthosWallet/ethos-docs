EthosConnect is a React library that makes it easy to connect a wallet to your dApp on Sui.

With EthosConnect you don't have to worry about which wallets can connect with your dApp. Any wallet that implements the [Sui Wallet Standard](https://github.com/MystenLabs/sui/tree/main/sdk/wallet-adapter#wallet-standard) will be able to connect to your dApp and when someone developers a new wallet that implements the Wallet Standard it will be able to connect to your dApp with no changes on your part.

And when you are ready you can enable email wallets, which allow wallet-less users to connect to your dApp through their email (social login coming soon) with no extra effort on your part (email wallets look identical to all other wallets from the dApp's perspective).
